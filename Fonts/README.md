## WHATS THIS?

These fonts need to be installed in the OS before installing 
all the neovim plugins; the font's are a dependency. I have
copied them here to make installing my nvim setup on other
machines easy.

Most of these fonts are nerd-fonts which add lots of useful emojies
to the glyph set, useful for file icons and other UI bits setup by
plugins.

## WINDOWS INSTALL

Just copy the font files (.ttf or .otf) to the "C:\Windows\Fonts" dir. 

## Linux Install

Just copy the font files to "~/.local/share/fonts" dir

This font can be set in nvim's init.lua as:

vim.cmd('set guifont=FiraCode\\ NF:h18')

where the h18 bit sets the text size.

note: The name when setting the font is different to
that which is show in the windows font dir:
	C:\Windows\Fonts
This difference caused a massive headache! Was so 
annoying the amount of time I wasted trying to figure
out why the font was not being set!

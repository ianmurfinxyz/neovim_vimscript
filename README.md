## :statue_of_liberty: Neovim Vimscript Configuration 

This config needs to be used with a [Nerd-Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/gh-pages) 
since it installs plugins which require such fonts. This repo contains some Nerd-Fonts that I have
used in this config for convenience.
